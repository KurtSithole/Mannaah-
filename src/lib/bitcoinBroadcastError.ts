/**
 * Broadcast-error classification for Bitcoin transactions.
 *
 * Both broadcast paths in the app (`broadcastBlockbookTx` over the
 * Blockbook WebSocket, and `broadcastTransaction` against an Esplora REST
 * `/tx` endpoint) surface `bitcoind`'s `sendrawtransaction` RPC error
 * string verbatim — sometimes wrapped (e.g. `Broadcast failed: <body>` from
 * the Esplora path) and sometimes accompanied by a network-framing string
 * (Blockbook timeout / WebSocket close / abort).
 *
 * Those raw strings are useless to a non-technical donor — "min relay fee
 * not met, 245 < 1000" doesn't tell them what to do. This module maps the
 * canonical bitcoind / mempool reject reasons onto a small enum the UI can
 * use to render an actionable alert with a "bump fee and retry" button.
 *
 * The matcher is intentionally substring-based. bitcoind has shipped
 * dozens of subtly different reject strings over the years (some prefixed
 * with `sendrawtransaction RPC error: …`, some not; some wrapped in JSON,
 * some not) and any node operator can stick their own text on top.
 * Substring matching against the stable "reason code" portions is
 * robust enough without trying to track every framing.
 *
 * When a number pair is parsed out of the canonical
 * `min relay fee not met, <actual> < <minimum>` form we surface both —
 * the UI uses them to display a concrete "current minimum: N sat/vB"
 * hint and, in the HD flow, to seed a custom fee rate.
 */

 * Classified broadcast failure. The UI renders different copy and recovery
