/**
 * Observes an element and reports whether it has entered the viewport.
 *
 * Designed for "render the card immediately, but defer the card's
 * expensive data fetching until it's actually on screen" patterns — most
 * importantly the campaign grids, where eagerly running
 * {@link useCampaignDonations} for all ~200 cards at once produced a burst
 * of Esplora `/address` + `/tx` calls that rate-limited every backend.
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *
 * - **Once-only by default** (`once: true`): the hook flips `inView` to
 *   `true` the first time the element intersects the viewport and then
 *   stops observing. This is what data-fetch gating wants — once a query
 *   has been allowed to run, TanStack Query's cache keeps the result, so
 *   there's no reason to tear it down when the element scrolls away.
 * - `rootMargin` pre-arms elements slightly before they scroll into view
 *   so data is already loading by the time the card is visible.
 *
 * SSR / no-IO environments: if `IntersectionObserver` is unavailable the
 * hook reports `inView: true` immediately so functionality degrades to the
 * old always-on behaviour rather than never loading.
 *
 * @example
 * const ref = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
 * const inView = useInView(ref);
 * const { data } = useSomeExpensiveQuery(id, { enabled: inView });
