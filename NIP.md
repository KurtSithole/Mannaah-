### Agora Protocols

| Protocol                 | Composed Kinds                          | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flat Communities | 34550, 30009, 8, 1111, 1984 | One-level badge membership with explicit moderators (NIP-72 ext) |
| Community Chat | 34550, 1311 | Realtime member chat scoped to a NIP-72 community |
| Campaign Moderation | 33863, 34550, 36639, 1621, 1985, 39089 | Discovery curation (hidden + featured axes) via moderator-signed labels in the `agora.moderation` namespace, gated by a follow-pack moderator roster. Covers campaigns, organizations, and pledges identically via `a` tags, and kind 1621 issue reports via `e` tags. |
| Issue Reporting | 30617, 1621, 1630–1633, 1985 | In-app bug reports published as NIP-34 issues against Agora's own repository announcement, optionally signed with a throwaway key. Status resolved from author + maintainers; abuse suppressed with `agora.moderation` labels. |
| Campaign Verification | 33863, 1985 | Positive trust signal: NIP-32 labels in the `agora.verified` namespace (value `verified`) vouching for a campaign. Open trust model — labels from any account count and the badge shows who signed; retracted via kind 5 deletion (author-match enforced). |
| HD Wallet Derivation | — | BIP-39 mnemonic deterministically derived from the user's nsec via HKDF; seeds a BIP-86 Taproot + BIP-352 silent-payment wallet importable into any BIP-39-compatible wallet (see [Agora HD Wallet](#agora-hd-wallet-derivation) below). |

### Agora Content Marker

Every event Agora publishes that represents a first-class Agora object carries the single-letter tag `["t", "agora"]`. This marker enables the Agora activity feed to filter strictly server-side via the relay-indexed `#t` filter (multi-letter tags like the NIP-89 `client` tag are not indexed by relays and are therefore unsuitable for this purpose).

#### Tagged kinds

| Kind  | Object              | Where tagged                                                  |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Note (top-level, reply, quote) | `ComposeBox` default for top-level kind 1 publishes |
| 1111  | NIP-22 comment      | `usePostComment` (all comments authored in Agora)             |
| 8333  | Onchain zap         | `useOnchainZap`, `useDonateCampaign`, `SendBitcoinDialog`     |
| 9041  | Zap goal            | `CreateGoalDialog`                                            |
| 33863 | Campaign            | `CreateCampaignPage`                                          |
| 31922 | Date calendar event | `CreateEventPage`, `CreateCommunityEventDialog`               |
| 31923 | Time calendar event | `CreateEventPage`, `CreateCommunityEventDialog`               |
| 34550 | Community           | `CreateCommunityPage`                                         |
| 36639 | Pledge              | `CreateActionPage`                                            |

The tag is added at publish time via the `withAgoraTag` helper in `src/lib/agoraNoteTags.ts`, which dedupes against any user-supplied `t:agora` tag.

#### Untagged kinds (intentional)

Reactions, reposts, follow lists, profile metadata, lists, settings, badges, vanish requests, encrypted DMs, and live chat are user-state or response events rather than first-class Agora content. Tagging them would pollute `#agora` hashtag surfaces without adding value to the activity feed.

Untagged on purpose: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 16, 62, 1311, 30009, 10000-series, 30078, and any NIP-04 / NIP-44 encrypted kind.

#### Querying

The Agora activity feed combines a `t:agora`-strict layer with an intentionally cross-client world layer:

```json
[
  { "kinds": [33863, 36639, 34550, 8333], "#t": ["agora", "Agora"] },
  { "kinds": [1111], "#t": ["agora", "Agora"], "#K": ["33863", "36639", "34550"] },
  { "kinds": [1111, 1068], "#k": ["iso3166", "geo"] },
  { "kinds": [1], "#t": ["agora", "Agora"] }
]
```

The first two filters surface only Agora-created content. The third surfaces all country/geo-rooted comments and polls regardless of origin — the world layer is intentionally cross-client. The fourth captures any kind 1 note carrying `#agora` (including hashtags users type themselves), which preserves viral / opt-in discovery.

Clients filter both case variants (`agora` and `Agora`) because Nostr `t` tags are conventionally lowercase but some clients normalize hashtags to title case.

#### Backward compatibility

Events published before this marker was adopted do not carry `t:agora` and therefore do not appear in the Agora activity feed. They remain reachable by direct link and via kind-specific directories (e.g. the moderator-curated `/campaigns`). Authors who wish to surface a legacy event in the feed can republish it (any edit through the Agora UI will add the marker automatically).

### Community Chat

Agora uses NIP-53 live chat messages (`kind:1311`) for realtime chat inside a NIP-72 community. Messages are scoped directly to the community definition's address using an `a` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 1311,
  "content": "Hello community!",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "34550:<community-author-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>", "", "root"]
  ]
}
```

Clients SHOULD query community chat with `{ "kinds": [1311], "#a": ["34550:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"] }`. Agora treats sending as members-only at the UI layer and applies the same community moderation overlay used for community posts.

### Community Kinds

These event kinds were created by community contributors and are supported by Ditto. Full specifications are maintained by their respective authors.

| Kind  | Name                   | Description                                                      | Spec                                                                                      |

## Kind 8333: Onchain Zap

### Summary

Regular event kind that records a **Bitcoin on-chain payment** ("onchain zap") sent in appreciation of a Nostr event or profile. Functions as the on-chain analogue of NIP-57 zap receipts (kind 9735), but without the LNURL round-trip: the event is self-attested by the sender and references a real Bitcoin transaction that clients can verify directly on-chain.

The kind number mirrors the convention of NIP-57: kind **9735** is the Lightning P2P port (per BOLT spec), and kind **8333** is the Bitcoin mainnet P2P port — a natural semantic pairing for Lightning vs. on-chain settlement.

Because every Nostr keypair deterministically maps to a Bitcoin Taproot (P2TR) address (both use 32-byte x-only secp256k1 keys, per BIP-340/BIP-341), an on-chain zap is simply a Bitcoin transaction whose output pays the recipient's derived Taproot address. The kind 8333 event links that transaction to the Nostr event or profile being zapped.

### Event Structure

Single-recipient zap (the common case — tipping a post or profile):

```json
{
  "kind": 8333,
  "pubkey": "<sender-pubkey>",
  "content": "Great post!",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<target-event-id>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["p", "<target-pubkey>"],
    ["i", "bitcoin:tx:<txid>"],
    ["amount", "<sats>"],
    ["alt", "On-chain zap: 25000 sats"]
  ]
}
```

Multi-recipient zap (one transaction paying multiple recipients — community splits):

```json
{
  "kind": 8333,
  "pubkey": "<sender-pubkey>",
  "content": "Great community!",
  "tags": [
    ["i", "bitcoin:tx:<txid>"],
    ["p", "<recipient-1-pubkey>"],
    ["p", "<recipient-2-pubkey>"],
    ["p", "<recipient-3-pubkey>"],
    ["amount", "<total-sats-paid-to-all-listed-recipients>"],
    ["a", "34550:<community-author>:<community-d-tag>"],
    ["K", "34550"],
    ["alt", "Donation: 75000 sats across 3 recipients"]
  ]
}
```

Campaign donation (one transaction paying a single campaign wallet — see Kind 33863 below):

```json
{
  "kind": 8333,
  "pubkey": "<donor-pubkey>",
  "content": "Keep up the good work.",
  "tags": [
    ["i", "bitcoin:tx:<txid>"],
    ["amount", "<sats-paid-to-campaign-wallet>"],
    ["a", "33863:<campaign-author>:<campaign-d-tag>"],
    ["K", "33863"],
    ["alt", "Donation to Save the Last Bookstore: 25000 sats"]
  ]
}
```

Campaign donation receipts MUST NOT include `p` tags — campaigns no longer have Nostr-identity recipients, only a `w` wallet endpoint. Verification matches tx outputs against the campaign's declared `w` address rather than derived Taproot addresses (see *Verification* and Kind 33863 below).

### Content

The `content` field is a human-readable comment from the sender (may be empty). It is NOT a zap request JSON (unlike NIP-57 kind 9735).

### Tags

| Tag      | Required | Description                                                                                  |
|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `i`      | Yes      | NIP-73 external content identifier. MUST be `bitcoin:tx:<txid>` where `<txid>` is a 64-char lowercase hex Bitcoin transaction ID. |
| `p`      | Yes (≥1) | 32-byte hex pubkey of a zap **recipient** (an author being paid). A single event MAY include multiple `p` tags when the transaction has one output per recipient — each `p` tag MUST correspond to at least one tx output paying that recipient's derived Taproot address. |
| `amount` | Yes      | **Total** amount paid in **satoshis** (decimal integer). This is the sum of outputs in the tx that paid the derived Taproot addresses of **all** listed `p` recipients combined — *not* the total tx value (it excludes the sender's change output). For single-recipient events this is the amount paid to that one recipient. |
| `e`      | If zapping an event | 32-byte hex ID of the event being zapped. Include a relay hint as the 3rd element where possible. |
| `a`      | If zapping an addressable event | Addressable event coordinate `<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`. Used instead of (or alongside) `e` for kinds 30000–39999. |
| `alt`    | Yes      | NIP-31 human-readable fallback.                                                              |

If neither `e` nor `a` is present, the zap targets the recipients' **profiles** (i.e. a tip to the pubkey(s), not to a specific event).

### Publishing Flow

1. Sender builds a Bitcoin transaction with one output per intended recipient, each paying the recipient's derived Taproot address (`nostrPubkeyToBitcoinAddress(recipientPubkey)`).
2. Sender broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin network and obtains the `txid`.
3. Sender signs and publishes a **single** kind 8333 event referencing that `txid` with one `p` tag per recipient and an `amount` tag carrying the total paid across all of them.
4. The event is published **after** broadcast; the txid is already final at that point.

### Batch / Community Zaps

A single Bitcoin transaction MAY pay multiple recipients by including one output per recipient. Clients SHOULD publish **one kind 8333 event per transaction**, listing every recipient under its own `p` tag and putting the combined total in the single `amount` tag. Per-recipient amounts are not encoded in the event — clients that need them recompute them from the on-chain transaction during verification (each `p` tag's derived Taproot address is matched against tx outputs).

For community-level zaps, clients MAY include the community addressable coordinate in an `a` tag and the community kind in a `K` tag:

```json
[
  ["i", "bitcoin:tx:<txid>"],
  ["p", "<recipient-1-pubkey>"],
  ["p", "<recipient-2-pubkey>"],
  ["amount", "5000"],
  ["a", "34550:<community-author>:<community-d-tag>"],
  ["K", "34550"],
  ["alt", "Bitcoin zap: 5000 sats across 2 recipients"]
]
```

The `amount` tag MUST be the sum of outputs paying the listed recipients; it MUST NOT include the sender's change output.

### Client Behavior

**Querying onchain zaps for an event:**

```json
{ "kinds": [8333], "#e": ["<target-event-id>"], "limit": 100 }
```

For addressable events, use `"#a": ["<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"]` instead. For profile-level zaps targeting a specific user, use `"#p": ["<pubkey>"]` — this matches both single-recipient events tagging that user and multi-recipient events where the user is one of several recipients.

**Verification (REQUIRED before trusting amounts):**

Clients MUST verify a kind 8333 event on-chain before counting it toward a zap total or displaying its amount. The `amount` tag is self-reported by the sender and would otherwise be trivially spoofable. Verification has two modes depending on the event shape:

*Identity-recipient mode* (the event has `p` tags — profile zaps, event zaps, community splits):

1. Extract the txid from the `i` tag.
2. Fetch the transaction from a Bitcoin data source (e.g. a mempool.space-compatible Esplora API).
3. For each `p` tag, derive the recipient's expected Taproot address.
4. Sum the values of all outputs in the transaction that pay any of the derived recipient addresses. This is the **verified amount**. Change outputs paying back to the **sender's** derived Taproot address MUST NOT be counted toward the verified amount — only outputs to listed recipients.

*Campaign-wallet mode* (the event has an `a` tag pointing at a kind 33863 campaign and no `p` tags):

1. Extract the txid from the `i` tag and the campaign coordinate from the `a` tag.
2. Fetch the campaign event and read its `w` tag to get the campaign's declared bech32(m) wallet address. Reject the receipt if `w` is missing, malformed, or starts with `sp1` (silent-payment campaigns do not publish receipts; see Kind 33863).
3. Fetch the transaction from a Bitcoin data source.
4. Sum the values of all outputs in the transaction that pay the campaign's `w` address. This is the **verified amount**.

In both modes:

5. If the verified amount is 0, the event SHOULD be discarded.
6. If the sender's `amount` tag exceeds the verified amount, clients MAY discard the event or MAY display the smaller verified amount (capping). Clients MUST NOT display or count the claimed amount when it exceeds the verified amount.
7. Unconfirmed transactions MAY be displayed as pending; clients MAY require confirmation before counting them toward public totals. Because unconfirmed transactions can be evicted (RBF, double-spend), clients SHOULD either exclude them from aggregate zap totals or clearly label them as pending.

When a client needs to attribute a multi-recipient event's amount to one specific recipient (e.g. rendering a profile zap-history entry), it MAY sum only the tx outputs paying that one recipient's derived Taproot address. Per-recipient amounts are not stored in the event — they are recomputed from the transaction at display time.

**Sender/recipient identity:** Clients SHOULD reject events where the sender's pubkey (`event.pubkey`) appears in any `p` tag. Self-zaps are trivial to fabricate (the sender already controls the destination address) and contribute nothing meaningful to zap totals. Outputs in the underlying transaction that pay the sender's own derived Taproot address are change outputs and MUST NOT be counted toward the verified amount regardless of the tag set.

**Deduplication:** Clients SHOULD deduplicate events that reference the same `txid` (an attacker could publish many events pointing at one real transaction). One kind 8333 event per `txid` is canonical — when multiple events reference the same `txid`, the earliest is preferred.

**Network scope:** This specification applies to Bitcoin **mainnet** only. Testnet, signet, and other networks are out of scope; addresses and txids on those networks MUST NOT be used in kind 8333 events.

### Comparison with NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps)

| Aspect | NIP-57 (kind 9735) | This spec (kind 8333) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Settlement | Lightning Network | Bitcoin L1 |
| Invoice / payment | LNURL + BOLT-11 invoice | Raw Bitcoin tx |
| Event issuer | Recipient's LNURL provider | Sender |
| Availability | Requires `lud06`/`lud16` on recipient profile | Always available (every Nostr pubkey has a derived Taproot addr) |
| Verification | Recipient zap-provider pubkey + bolt11 amount | On-chain tx verified against derived recipient address |
| Finality | Instant | Confirms in ~10 min (mempool first) |
| Fees | Sub-satoshi typical | Significant at low amounts |

The two zap kinds are complementary. Clients SHOULD sum verified amounts from both kinds when displaying total zap stats for a post or profile.

## Kind 33863: Campaign

### Summary

Addressable event representing a **self-authored fundraising campaign**. A campaign carries marketing-style metadata (title, summary, banner image, markdown story, optional goal, optional country) and one or two Bitcoin wallet endpoints declared in `w` tags. Each wallet endpoint is either a public on-chain bech32(m) address (`bc1q…`, `bc1p…`) or a silent-payment code (`sp1…`, per BIP-352). The mode of each endpoint is inferred from the prefix — the client renders a QR code that combines the present endpoints and adjusts the donation-progress UI accordingly. A campaign MAY declare **at most one** endpoint per mode (at most one on-chain address and at most one silent-payment code). A campaign MAY additionally declare an optional `pay` tag — an external HTTPS fiat-checkout URL — as a secondary, off-Nostr donation path; fiat donations settle externally through the checkout provider. When that endpoint exposes a machine-readable total (see below), clients fold the fiat amount raised into the campaign total; otherwise it is simply a hand-off link. The `pay` tag never substitutes for `w`: a valid campaign MUST still carry at least one `w` tag.

The author of the event is also the beneficiary. Campaigns are never authored on behalf of someone else; the event creator owns the wallet declared in `w` and receives the donations. To stop accepting donations, the creator publishes a NIP-09 kind 5 deletion request referencing the campaign's `a` coordinate.

The kind is addressable so the creator can edit the story, banner, goal, and wallet over the life of the campaign without minting new identifiers. The `d` tag is the campaign's slug.

### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 33863,
  "pubkey": "<creator-pubkey>",
  "content": "<markdown story>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "save-the-last-bookstore"],

    ["title", "Save the Last Bookstore"],
    ["summary", "Help our 40-year-old neighborhood bookstore make rent through winter."],
    ["banner", "https://blossom.example/abc123.jpg"],
    ["imeta",
      "url https://blossom.example/abc123.jpg",
      "m image/jpeg",
      "x abc123def456...",
      "dim 1600x900",
      "blurhash LKO2?U%2Tw=w]~RBVZRi};RPxuwH",
      "alt Storefront of the Last Bookstore at dusk"
    ],
    ["alt", "Fundraising campaign: Save the Last Bookstore"],

    ["w", "bc1p7w2k3xq9...xyz"],
    ["w", "sp1qq...verylongsilentpaymentcode..."],

    ["pay", "https://pay.example.com/123"],

    ["goal", "25000"],

    ["i", "iso3166:US"],
    ["k", "iso3166"],
    ["t", "legal-defense"],
    ["t", "mutual-aid"]
  ]
}
```

A silent-payment-only campaign omits the `bc1…` `w` tag and carries only the `sp1…`:

```json
["w", "sp1qq...verylongsilentpaymentcode..."]
```

An on-chain-only campaign omits the `sp1…` `w` tag and carries only the `bc1…`:

```json
["w", "bc1p7w2k3xq9...xyz"]
```

### Content

The `content` field is the **campaign story**, formatted as Markdown. Clients SHOULD render it with the same Markdown renderer they use for NIP-23 long-form content. Empty content is permitted (e.g. for a campaign that lives entirely in its summary).

### Tags

| Tag       | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `d`       | Yes      | Campaign slug, unique per author. Forms the addressable coordinate `33863:<pubkey>:<d>`.                                                                                                                                     |
| `title`   | Yes      | Display title of the campaign (plain text, max ~200 chars).                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `w`       | Yes      | Bitcoin wallet endpoint. The 2nd element is a single bech32(m) string: a mainnet on-chain address starting with `bc1q` (P2WPKH/P2WSH) or `bc1p` (P2TR), **or** a silent-payment code starting with `sp1` per BIP-352. A campaign MUST carry at least one `w` tag and MAY carry up to two — at most one per mode (on-chain and silent payment). |
| `summary` | Recommended | Short one-paragraph tagline shown in feed cards and previews.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `banner`  | Recommended | HTTPS URL of the wide banner image. Clients MUST sanitize the URL (see `sanitizeUrl()` in `nostr-security`) before rendering, and SHOULD pair the URL with a NIP-92 `imeta` tag for dimensions, blurhash, MIME type, and SHA-256. |
| `imeta`   | Recommended | NIP-92 media metadata for the banner. The first `url <value>` pair MUST match the `banner` URL; clients SHOULD ignore an `imeta` whose URL does not match.                                                                  |
| `goal`    | Optional | Fundraising goal in **integer US Dollars** (no unit suffix, no decimals). Clients MAY display an estimated sat-equivalent at view time using a live exchange rate.                                                          |
| `pay`     | Optional | HTTPS URL of an external fiat payment page (e.g. a Stripe Checkout link). Enables donors to support the campaign in fiat by opening the URL in a browser. The URL doubles as a JSON info endpoint: when fetched with `Accept: application/json` it SHOULD return `{ "received": <number> }`, the total fiat raised in the currency's minor unit (e.g. USD cents). Clients that receive such a response fold the fiat amount (converted to sats at the current BTC price) into the campaign's raised total; endpoints that answer with HTML instead are treated as a plain hand-off link and contribute nothing. A campaign carries **at most one** `pay` tag. Clients MUST sanitize the URL (see `sanitizeUrl()` in `nostr-security`) before fetching or rendering; only well-formed `https:` URLs are honored. This tag never substitutes for `w` — a valid campaign MUST still carry at least one `w` tag. |
| `i`       | Recommended | NIP-73 country identifier. SHOULD be `iso3166:<code>` with an uppercase ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (e.g. `iso3166:VE`).                                                                                          |
| `k`       | Recommended if `i` is present | NIP-73 external content kind. For country identifiers this SHOULD be `iso3166`.                                                                                                              |
| `t`       | Optional | User-entered discovery/category tags. Agora also adds `t:agora` as the app marker; other `t` values are freeform topics such as `legal-defense` or `mutual-aid`. |
| `alt`     | Recommended | NIP-31 human-readable fallback.                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### Wallet Modes

The prefix of each `w` value selects one of two donation modes. Clients MUST detect the mode from the prefix; the event carries no other mode discriminator. When a campaign carries both an on-chain and a silent-payment endpoint, the client SHOULD present a single combined QR (see "Combined QR" below) so a scan offers the donor's wallet whichever endpoint it supports, while still rendering on-chain aggregate UI from the on-chain endpoint and the silent-payment privacy notice from the silent-payment endpoint.

| Prefix              | Mode      | Description                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bc1q…` / `bc1p…`   | On-chain  | Public mainnet bech32(m) address. Donations are traceable; clients show a progress bar, total raised, and donation list.                |
| `sp1…`              | Silent payment | BIP-352 silent-payment code. Donations are **unlinkable by design**. Clients MUST hide all aggregate totals and progress UI (see below). |

Other prefixes (`tb1…`, `bcrt1…`, `tsp1…`, lightning invoices, etc.) MUST be rejected at parse time; the campaign does not render. A campaign carrying two `w` tags of the same mode (e.g., two `bc1…` addresses) is invalid and MUST NOT render — only one endpoint per mode is permitted.

Clients SHOULD validate the bech32(m) checksum of each `w` value, not just its prefix.

### Combined QR

When a campaign declares both endpoints, clients SHOULD render a single BIP-21 URI that combines them:

```
bitcoin:<bc1-address>?sp=<sp1-code>
```

BIP-352-aware wallets pick the `sp=` parameter and use the silent-payment flow; legacy wallets fall back to the on-chain address. Clients MAY also surface each endpoint's raw string as a copyable affordance so donors who prefer one over the other can choose explicitly. A single-endpoint campaign uses the standard form: `bitcoin:<bc1-address>` (on-chain only) or `bitcoin:?sp=<sp1-code>` (silent payment only).

### Client Behavior by Mode

Each endpoint type drives its own UI elements independently. A dual-endpoint campaign shows the on-chain aggregate UI (computed from the on-chain endpoint) **and** the silent-payment privacy notice (because at least some donations may flow through the SP endpoint and not be visible in any aggregate).

| UI element                  | On-chain (`bc1`) present                                        | Silent payment (`sp1`) present                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| QR code                     | bech32(m) address in BIP-21 `bitcoin:` URI                      | SP code in BIP-21 `?sp=` extension (combined with on-chain address when both are present) |
| "Raised X" / progress bar   | Shown, computed from cumulative `chain_stats.funded_txo_sum` on the on-chain `w` address via an Esplora endpoint (default mempool.space). Kind 8333 receipts are **not** the source of this total — donors paying the BIP-21 QR with a native wallet would otherwise be missed. | **Not contributed.** When the on-chain endpoint is absent, aggregate UI is hidden entirely. |
| Donor / recent-donation list| Shown, populated from verified kind 8333 receipts against the on-chain address (attribution only — these do not feed the headline total). | **Not contributed.**                                   |
| Goal display                | Shown as USD target with optional sat-equivalent estimate       | Shown as USD target; no progress computation when on-chain endpoint is absent |
| Donation receipt published  | Donor's client publishes a kind 8333 receipt against the on-chain endpoint (see below) | **No receipt published.** Publishing one would defeat SP unlinkability and is forbidden. |

For campaigns with **only** a silent-payment endpoint (no on-chain endpoint), clients MUST NOT attempt to scan the chain, MUST NOT publish receipts, and MUST NOT display any aggregate that could leak donation activity. For dual-endpoint campaigns, the on-chain aggregate UI is permitted but clients SHOULD render a privacy notice indicating that silent-payment donations are not reflected in the totals.

### Donation Flow — On-chain (`bc1`)

1. Donor opens the campaign and chooses an amount.
2. Donor's client constructs and broadcasts a Bitcoin transaction paying the campaign's `w` address.
3. After broadcast, the donor's client publishes a single kind 8333 receipt:

   ```json
   [
     ["i", "bitcoin:tx:<txid>"],
     ["amount", "<sats-paid-to-campaign-wallet>"],
     ["a", "33863:<campaign-author-pubkey>:<campaign-d-tag>"],
     ["K", "33863"],
     ["alt", "Donation to <campaign-title>: <total-amount> sats"]
   ]
   ```

   The receipt MUST NOT carry `p` tags — campaigns are not Nostr-identity recipients. The `amount` tag is the sum of tx outputs paying the campaign's `w` address (excluding the donor's change output).

4. The receipt is published **after** the tx is broadcast; the txid is already final at that point. A receipt-publish failure does not roll back the donation — the on-chain transaction stands.

### Donation Flow — Silent Payment (`sp1`)

1. Donor opens the campaign and chooses an amount.
2. Donor's client uses the campaign's SP code to derive a fresh, one-time Taproot output script per BIP-352.
3. Donor broadcasts a Bitcoin transaction paying that derived output.
4. **No Nostr event is published.** The campaign owner discovers the donation by scanning the chain locally with their SP private key.

Silent-payment unlinkability is the entire point of this mode. Clients MUST NOT publish receipts, MUST NOT advertise the donation in any other Nostr event (replies, mentions, etc.) on the donor's behalf, and MUST NOT correlate the donor's pubkey with the campaign in any persisted client telemetry.

### Donation Flow — Fiat (`pay`)

The optional `pay` tag adds a secondary, off-Nostr fiat path alongside the Bitcoin endpoints. It is a convenience for donors who prefer to pay with a card or other fiat rail via a hosted checkout page (e.g. Stripe Checkout, BTCPay Server's fiat flow, or any external payment processor the campaign owner operates).

1. Donor opens the campaign and selects the fiat option.
2. Donor's client sanitizes the `pay` URL and opens it in a browser (via `openUrl()` for Capacitor compatibility — see the `capacitor-compat` skill). The client hands off to the external checkout page and plays no further part in the payment.
3. **No Nostr event is published.** Settlement happens entirely on the external payment processor; Agora never sees the funds and cannot verify them on-chain.

Individual fiat donations are not verifiable on-chain and never appear in the kind 8333 donation list. However, when the `pay` endpoint reports an aggregate total (`{ "received": <cents> }` under `Accept: application/json`), clients fold that fiat amount into the headline "raised" number by converting it to sats at the current BTC price (see *Compute the "raised" total* below). This is a best-effort figure sourced from — and trusted to — the campaign owner's checkout provider, not an on-chain-verifiable amount. A `pay` endpoint that serves only an HTML checkout page contributes nothing to the total and remains a pure hand-off link.

The `pay` tag is strictly additive and never replaces the Bitcoin endpoints: a campaign that carries a `pay` tag but no `w` tag is **invalid** and MUST NOT render (see *Client Behavior* below). Agora remains a non-custodial, peer-to-peer app — the fiat path is an external link the donor follows at their own discretion, not a channel Agora custodies or converts through.

### Querying

**List campaigns (newest first):**

```json
{ "kinds": [33863], "limit": 50 }
```

**Fetch a specific campaign:**

```json
{ "kinds": [33863], "authors": ["<creator-pubkey>"], "#d": ["<slug>"], "limit": 1 }
```

**Compute the "raised" total:**

The headline "raised" amount for an on-chain campaign MUST be sourced **directly from the campaign's on-chain `w` address**, not by aggregating kind 8333 receipts. Specifically, clients SHOULD query a mempool.space-compatible Esplora endpoint for the address and use the cumulative `chain_stats.funded_txo_sum` (plus `mempool_stats.funded_txo_sum` if surfacing pending donations) as the total raised.

This is the source of truth for three reasons:

1. **Completeness.** Donors who pay the BIP-21 QR with a native wallet do not publish a kind 8333 receipt. Aggregating receipts would undercount the campaign.
2. **Forgery resistance.** A single Esplora `GET /address/<addr>` call cannot be spoofed by Nostr publishers, whereas verifying 500+ receipts against the chain is slower and more brittle (relay availability, pagination, replay attempts).
3. **Stability.** `funded_txo_sum` is cumulative — it does not regress when the beneficiary spends from the address.

When the campaign also carries a `pay` tag, clients SHOULD additionally fetch that URL with `Accept: application/json`. If the endpoint returns `{ "received": <number> }` (the total fiat raised in the currency's minor unit — e.g. USD cents), clients convert it to sats at the current BTC price and add it to the on-chain total above. Endpoints that ignore the `Accept` header and return an HTML checkout page contribute nothing. Fiat totals apply only to campaigns that expose an on-chain `w` endpoint; silent-payment-only campaigns hide all aggregate UI and MUST NOT surface a fiat total either.

**List individual donations (for the recent-donations sidebar):**

```json
{ "kinds": [8333], "#a": ["33863:<creator-pubkey>:<slug>"], "limit": 500 }
```

Kind 8333 receipts are used **only** to attribute individual donations to Nostr identities (donor pubkey, comment, timestamp) — not to compute the campaign total. Clients MUST still verify each receipt on-chain per the *Campaign-wallet mode* verification rules in the kind 8333 section before displaying it.

**Filter by country:**

```json
{ "kinds": [33863], "#i": ["iso3166:VE"], "limit": 50 }
```

**Fetch pinned event comments:**

Event owners MAY pin important comments or activity feed events with a NIP-78 app-specific data event (`kind: 30078`) authored by the root event owner. The `d` tag is scoped to the root event coordinate. Agora uses this for campaigns (`33863`), pledges (`36639`), organizations (`34550`), and calendar events (`31922` / `31923`).

```json
{
  "kind": 30078,
  "pubkey": "<root-event-author-pubkey>",
  "content": "{\"pinnedEvents\":[\"<event-id-2>\",\"<event-id-1>\"]}",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "agora-pinned-comments:<kind>:<root-event-author-pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["a", "<kind>:<root-event-author-pubkey>:<d-tag>"],
    ["k", "<kind>"],
    ["alt", "Pinned event comments"]
  ]
}
```

Clients SHOULD query the pin list with:

```json
{ "kinds": [30078], "authors": ["<root-event-author-pubkey>"], "#d": ["agora-pinned-comments:<kind>:<root-event-author-pubkey>:<d-tag>"], "limit": 1 }
```

The `pinnedEvents` array is ordered newest pin first. Pinning an already-pinned event removes it. Clients SHOULD ignore pin lists not authored by the root event owner.

### Client Behavior

- **Wallet validity:** clients MUST reject events that carry no `w` tag, that carry more than one `w` tag of the same mode (e.g., two `bc1…` addresses), or whose `w` values fail bech32(m) checksum validation for one of the supported prefixes. Invalid campaigns do not render. The optional `pay` tag does **not** satisfy this requirement — a campaign carrying a `pay` tag but no valid `w` tag is invalid and MUST NOT render.
- **Fiat pay link:** clients MAY render a fiat-donation affordance when a valid `pay` tag is present. The URL MUST be sanitized (`sanitizeUrl()`) before it lands in any `href` or is passed to `openUrl()`; a `pay` value that is not a well-formed `https:` URL MUST be ignored (the rest of the campaign still renders). At most one `pay` tag is honored; if multiple are present, clients SHOULD use the first valid one. Fiat donations MUST NOT be counted toward the campaign's "raised" total or donation list (see *Donation Flow — Fiat* above).
- **Editability:** the creator MAY republish the same `(33863, pubkey, d)` triple to update any field, including the `w` wallet endpoint. Clients SHOULD keep `published_at` from the first publish on subsequent edits (NIP-23 convention).
- **Closing a campaign:** there is no `status` tag. To stop accepting donations, the creator publishes a NIP-09 kind 5 deletion request referencing the campaign's `a` coordinate. Clients SHOULD honor the deletion by removing the campaign from discovery feeds. Historical kind 8333 receipts MAY still be rendered against the (now-deleted) campaign coordinate so donors can find their past donations.
- **Categories:** clients MAY use user-entered `t` tags for topic filtering and discovery. Agora reserves `t:agora` as its app marker but does not reserve any other topic namespace.
- **Migration:** kind 33863 has no relationship to any earlier campaign kind. Clients MUST NOT read, merge, or migrate events of any other kind into the kind 33863 namespace.

### Agora Moderation Labels

Agora curates which kind 33863 campaigns appear on the homepage (`/`) and on the Support directory (`/campaigns`), which kind 34550 organizations appear in the Featured shelf on `/communities`, and which kind 36639 pledges appear in the discovery surfaces on `/pledges`, via moderator-signed NIP-32 label events (kind 1985) in a dedicated label namespace. The labeled event itself is never modified — surfacing is purely a client-side rollup of label events.

Campaigns, organizations, and pledges share a single label namespace and a single moderator pack (Team Soapbox); the only thing distinguishing the three streams is the kind prefix on the `a` tag of each label:

- `33863:<author-pubkey>:<d>` — campaign (kind 33863, see "Open Campaigns" above).
- `34550:<author-pubkey>:<d>` — organization (kind 34550, NIP-72 community definition).
- `36639:<author-pubkey>:<d>` — pledge (kind 36639, see "Pledge" below).

A client surfacing campaigns MUST filter folded labels to those whose `a` tag starts with `33863:`. A client surfacing organizations MUST filter to `34550:`. A client surfacing pledges MUST filter to `36639:`. Mixing the streams would let a moderator's `featured` label on a campaign appear to feature an unrelated pledge with the same `d` tag, or any other cross-surface bleed.

#### Labeling regular events (issue reports)

A fourth surface rides the same namespace and moderator pack, but targets a **regular** event rather than an addressable one: NIP-34 kind 1621 issues filed against Agora's own repository from the in-app reporter at `/issues`. Because kind 1621 is a regular event, its labels reference it with an `e` tag (event id) instead of an `a` tag (coordinate).

Anyone may publish a kind 1621 issue against a public repository — that is the point of an issue tracker — and Agora renders that list in-app to every user. The `hide` axis is therefore the defense against abuse published into a surface the app displays; the `featured` axis pins genuine known issues to the top so users find them before filing a duplicate.

An `e` tag carries no kind prefix, so the prefix rule above has no equivalent here. Instead, **clients MUST scope the label query relay-side to event ids they already fetched for the surface being rendered** (`"#e": [<issue-ids…>]`). This is strictly tighter than a prefix check: a label naming an id the client never asked for is never retrieved. Clients MUST NOT fold `e`-tagged labels from an unscoped query, and MUST NOT mix `e`-keyed rollups with `a`-keyed ones — an event id and a coordinate are both opaque strings, and conflating the two key spaces fails open.

Status resolution for an issue is a separate concern from moderation and follows NIP-34: the newest status event (kinds 1630–1633) is trusted only from the issue's author or the repository's owner and maintainers. A client MUST NOT accept a status event from an arbitrary pubkey, or any stranger could mark real reports resolved.

#### Namespace

```
agora.moderation
```

Each label event carries the namespace twice, per NIP-32:

- A capital-`L` "namespace" tag (relay-indexed for queries).
- A lowercase `l` tag where the 2nd element is the label value and the 3rd is the namespace.

#### Label values

Two independent axes are defined; the newest moderator-signed label per axis per coordinate wins. All three surfaces (campaigns, organizations, pledges) use the same two axes — every Agora-tagged entity is publicly visible by default, and moderation reduces to suppressing unwanted entries (`hide`) and lifting curated ones into a featured row (`featured`).

| Axis     | Values                    | Surfaces                           | Meaning                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| hide     | `hidden`, `unhidden`      | campaigns, organizations, pledges  | `hidden` suppresses the target everywhere it would otherwise appear. `unhidden` retracts a previous hide. |
| featured | `featured`, `unfeatured`  | campaigns, organizations, pledges  | `featured` places the target in a hand-picked Featured row. `unfeatured` retracts. |

> **Legacy `approved` / `unapproved` labels.** A previous revision of this spec defined a third axis ("approval") used only by campaigns to gate which campaigns appeared on the home page. The axis was retired once `featured` became the single positive-curation mechanism on the home page. Clients MUST ignore `approved` / `unapproved` labels and SHOULD NOT publish new ones. Existing labels in relay archives are dead data.

Surfacing rules (hide always wins):

**Campaigns**

- **Featured row on `/`** — iff the latest featured label is `featured` AND the latest hide label is not `hidden`. Ordered by the featured label's effective rank (see Moderator-driven Ordering), descending.
- **Discover shelf on `/campaigns`** — iff the latest hide label is not `hidden`. Every non-hidden campaign on the network is enumerable here; the home page's Featured row is a curated subset, not a gate.
- **Moderator-only "Hidden"** — iff hidden. Surfaces the suppressed set so moderators can unhide.

**Organizations**

- **Featured shelf on `/communities`** — iff the latest featured label is `featured` AND the latest hide label is not `hidden`. Ordered by the featured label's effective rank, descending (see Moderator-driven Ordering).
- **"My organizations" shelf on `/communities`** — intentionally ignores all moderation labels. A user's own founded, moderated, or followed organizations always render regardless of label state.
- **Moderator-only "Needs review"** — iff `t:agora` AND not featured AND not hidden. Surfaces orgs minted through Agora's create flow that haven't been triaged into Featured or Hidden yet.
- **Moderator-only "Hidden"** — iff hidden.
- **Hide enforcement on other organization discovery surfaces** — clients SHOULD suppress `hidden` organizations from any future "All organizations" / browse surface for non-moderators. Moderators MAY see hidden organizations with a "Hidden" treatment so they can unhide.

**Pledges**

- **Discovery surfaces on `/pledges`** — non-moderators MUST NOT see `hidden` pledges in the active / upcoming / past sections, the search results grid, or any future browse surface. Moderators MAY opt-in to seeing hidden pledges via a Show-hidden toggle so they can unhide.
- **Author-own surfaces** — a pledge author's own pledges in their profile always render regardless of moderation state. Moderation governs public discovery, not authorship.
- **Direct-URL access** — a pledge's detail page (`/<naddr>`) renders regardless of moderation state. Hidden pledges remain reachable by anyone who has the link; moderation only governs which surfaces enumerate them.
- **Featured** — reserved for a future curated pledge shelf. The `featured` axis is defined for symmetry with campaigns/organizations, and clients MAY use it when implementing such a shelf.

#### Moderator-driven Ordering

The Featured row is sorted by the **effective rank** of the moderator's latest `featured` label per campaign coordinate, descending.

A label's effective rank is the numeric value of its `["rank", "<number>"]` tag if present, falling back to the label's `created_at` when no rank tag is set. Labels published before this feature existed — and any normal hide / feature actions that don't carry a rank — surface with their `created_at` as the effective rank, so newer feature actions naturally float to the top.

The fold rule per `(coord, axis)` is unchanged: the newest event by `created_at` wins. Encoding order in the `created_at` itself would conflict with that rule the moment a moderator tried to lower a campaign's position — the new label would have an older `created_at` than the existing one and lose the fold. The rank tag decouples sort key from event recency so reorder publishes always use `created_at = now` and the fold always picks them up.

A moderator MAY reorder the row by republishing the `featured` label for a campaign with a `rank` tag carrying a chosen integer. Three operations cover the common cases:

- **Move to top** — publish with `rank = max(freshRank, currentTopRank + 1)`, where `freshRank` is a strictly-monotonic integer the client SHOULD source from current wall-clock time at sub-second resolution (Agora uses `Date.now() * 1000`). The `max` guard handles a (rare) clock-skewed existing rank that's already above `freshRank`.
- **Move up by one** — publish with `rank = neighborAbove.rank + 1`, where `neighborAbove` is the label sorted directly above the campaign being moved.
- **Move down by one** — publish with `rank = neighborBelow.rank - 1`. Only the moved campaign's label is republished; the neighbor below is untouched.

A general "drop at index `j`" (e.g. drag-and-drop in a moderator UI) is implemented by computing the two new neighbors of the moved campaign in the rearranged list and choosing any integer rank strictly between their ranks. When the gap is too tight (`prev.rank - next.rank < 2`), clients SHOULD pick `next.rank + 1` and accept that the rendered list may briefly be off by one until the next reorder leaves a wider gap. Using a sub-second-resolution `freshRank` keeps inter-rank gaps wide enough for many midpoint inserts before any renumbering is needed.

The conflict model matches the rest of the moderation namespace: the newest label per `(coord, axis)` from any moderator wins. Concurrent reorders by two moderators resolve to whoever's publish lands later; clients SHOULD refetch labels after a reorder publish to surface the authoritative order.

Reorder labels remain valid moderation labels in every other respect. Clients that don't recognize the `rank` tag simply read the label's axis state and ignore the rank — the labels are not a separate kind, not a separate namespace, and not a new tag namespace. Non-Agora clients see exactly the same hide / feature state they always have.

The featured row is the only Agora surface that uses moderator-driven ordering today. The same mechanism MAY be applied to the organization or pledge featured shelves if those grow a curation UI; until then, those shelves sort by `created_at` (the legacy behavior, identical to using a missing rank tag).

#### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.moderation"],
    ["l", "featured", "agora.moderation"],
    ["a", "33863:<author-pubkey>:<campaign-d-tag>"],
    ["alt", "Campaign moderation: featured"]
  ]
}
```

An organization label has the same shape with a kind 34550 `a` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.moderation"],
    ["l", "featured", "agora.moderation"],
    ["a", "34550:<author-pubkey>:<organization-d-tag>"],
    ["alt", "Organization moderation: featured"]
  ]
}
```

A pledge label has the same shape with a kind 36639 `a` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.moderation"],
    ["l", "hidden", "agora.moderation"],
    ["a", "36639:<author-pubkey>:<pledge-d-tag>"],
    ["alt", "Pledge moderation: hidden"]
  ]
}
```

An issue label targets a regular event, so it carries an `e` tag instead of an `a` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.moderation"],
    ["l", "hidden", "agora.moderation"],
    ["e", "<kind-1621-event-id>"],
    ["alt", "Issue moderation: hidden"]
  ]
}
```

Required tags:

- `L` set to `agora.moderation`.
- `l` with the label value as the 2nd element and `agora.moderation` as the 3rd.
- Exactly one target reference:
  - `a` referencing the target coordinate (`33863:<pubkey>:<d>` for a campaign, `34550:<pubkey>:<d>` for an organization, `36639:<pubkey>:<d>` for a pledge), or
  - `e` referencing the target event id, for regular events (kind 1621 issues).
- `alt` (NIP-31) — clients without label support will display this string. The `alt` value SHOULD identify the surface (e.g. `Campaign moderation: featured`, `Organization moderation: featured`, or `Pledge moderation: hidden`) so non-Agora clients can read it.

Optional tags:

- `rank` — single string element parsed as an integer. Used on `featured` labels to position the target within the moderator-curated Featured row; see Moderator-driven Ordering above. Labels without this tag sort by `created_at` (descending), which is the correct behavior for all non-reorder uses.

A label with a rank tag looks like:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.moderation"],
    ["l", "featured", "agora.moderation"],
    ["a", "33863:<author-pubkey>:<campaign-d-tag>"],
    ["rank", "1700000000123000"],
    ["alt", "Campaign moderation: featured"]
  ]
}
```

#### Trust Model

Only label events authored by current members of the **Team Soapbox** follow pack are honored. The pack is a kind 39089 (NIP-51 follow pack) addressable event:

```
kind:       39089
pubkey:     932614571afcbad4d17a191ee281e39eebbb41b93fac8fd87829622aeb112f4d
d-tag:      k4p5w0n22suf
```

The pack `p` tags are the authoritative moderator list. Clients MUST pin `authors:` on their label REQ to the pack `p` tags; events from non-pack authors MUST be ignored. This means:

- Self-promotion is impossible unless the pack author has added you.
- A moderator removed from the pack immediately loses moderation authority — campaigns kept alive on the Featured row only by their labels fall off the row until another moderator features them.
- The pack author (single signer) can reset the entire moderator roster by republishing the pack.

The same moderator set governs both campaign and organization labels. Carving out per-surface moderator subsets is out of scope; clients that need that distinction would have to introduce a second follow pack and a second label namespace.

#### Querying

Step 1 — fetch the pack:

```json
{
  "kinds": [39089],
  "authors": ["932614571afcbad4d17a191ee281e39eebbb41b93fac8fd87829622aeb112f4d"],
  "#d": ["k4p5w0n22suf"],
  "limit": 1
}
```

Step 2 — fetch label events from pack members in the namespace:

```json
{
  "kinds": [1985],
  "authors": ["<pack p-tag 1>", "<pack p-tag 2>", "..."],
  "#L": ["agora.moderation"],
  "limit": 2000
}
```

Step 3 — fold by `(coord, axis)`, latest-`created_at`-wins, filtering to the relevant kind prefix (`33863:` for campaigns or `34550:` for organizations). Then fetch the targeted events themselves — one filter per author (bundled in a single REQ) keyed by their d-tags.

#### Client Behavior

- Clients SHOULD render hide/feature controls only for users whose pubkey appears in the pack.
- Clients MAY display "Hidden" badges on hidden campaigns/organizations/pledges when viewed by a moderator, and SHOULD NOT render them at all to non-moderators.
- Authors' own campaigns, organizations, and pledges are visible at their NIP-19 routes regardless of moderation state. The campaign URL remains live and donatable even when the campaign is not on the home page's Featured row.

#### Campaign Verification Labels (`agora.verified`)

Separately from the hide/feature moderation axes above, Agora supports a positive **verification** signal: an account vouches for a specific campaign. Verification is a distinct NIP-32 label namespace, `agora.verified`, with a single value `verified`. It rides the same kind 1985 label kind as the hide/feature labels, but is otherwise independent of `agora.moderation` — no axes, no rank, no moderator gate, purely additive.

A verification label points at one campaign coordinate (`33863:<pubkey>:<d>`):

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["L", "agora.verified"],
    ["l", "verified", "agora.verified"],
    ["a", "33863:<campaign-pubkey>:<campaign-d>"],
    ["alt", "Campaign verification"]
  ]
}
```

**Trust model.** Verification is **open**: labels from any pubkey are honored — clients MUST NOT restrict the read to a moderator allowlist. This works because the badge is attributed, never anonymous: clients MUST display *who* signed each verification (avatar / profile link), so donors judge the verifier rather than trusting a boolean. Two integrity rules apply. **Self-verifications**: a label whose author equals the campaign author (the pubkey inside the `a` coordinate) carries no trust signal and MUST be ignored. **Retraction**: a kind 5 deletion only removes a label when the deletion's signer is the label's author — clients MUST enforce this author match when honoring deletions, otherwise a third party could strip someone else's verification. (Contrast with the `agora.moderation` namespace above, which remains strictly gated by the moderator pack.)

**Reading.** One filter fetches every verification from every author:

```json
{
  "kinds": [1985],
  "#L": ["agora.verified"],
  "#l": ["verified"],
  "limit": 2000
}
```

Fold by `(coord, verifier)`, keeping the newest label per pair. A campaign is "verified by" the set of accounts with a surviving label; clients SHOULD render the verifiers' avatars stacked as a badge, with multiple verifiers forming a stack.

**Retraction.** There is no `unverified` value. A verifier retracts a verification by publishing a NIP-09 kind 5 deletion of their own label event (referenced by `e` tag plus `k: 1985`). A kind 5 only takes effect on events authored by the signer, so a verifier can only remove their own verification.

**Client behavior.**
- Clients SHOULD render the verify / remove-verification control for campaign moderators and for self-declared verifiers (accounts with a kind 14672 verifier statement, see below) — but MUST honor labels on read regardless of who signed them (except self-verifications, which MUST be ignored). Clients SHOULD hide the verify control on the viewer's own campaigns.
- Verification is purely additive — it never hides or promotes a campaign on its own. It is a trust hint layered over whatever moderation/discovery state already applies.
- The label kind 1985 read is routed to Agora's search relays (`relay.ditto.pub`, `relay.dreamith.to`) where these labels are published.

---

## Kind 14672: Verifier Statement

### Summary

Replaceable event kind for a **self-authored statement describing how the author verifies campaigns**. Anyone can "become a verifier" simply by publishing one of these events — there is no gatekeeper. The statement is a public, freeform explanation of the diligence process the author applies before vouching for a campaign, so donors can judge whether to trust that author's judgement.

Exactly one statement per user (replaceable, no `d` tag): publishing a new event replaces the previous one. Clients surface the statement prominently on the author's profile page.

This kind is **distinct from** the `agora.verified` campaign-verification labels (kind 1985, see Kind 33863 above). Those vouch for one specific campaign; a kind 14672 statement is a self-published description of an author's *general* verification methodology. Both are open (no allowlist): the statement is a reputation signal donors read alongside the author's per-campaign labels, not an access-control mechanism.

### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 14672,
  "pubkey": "<author-pubkey>",
  "content": "I personally visit each campaign organizer over video call, confirm their identity against a government ID, and cross-check the cause with at least two independent local sources before I vouch for it. ...",
  "tags": [
    ["alt", "Verifier statement: how this account verifies campaigns"],
    ["t", "agora"]
  ]
}
```

### Content

The `content` field is the verifier statement, formatted as **Markdown**. Clients SHOULD render it with the same Markdown renderer they use for other long-form Agora content (campaign stories, policy pages). Empty or whitespace-only content means the author has **withdrawn** their verifier statement — clients MUST treat an empty-content event the same as no event (the author is no longer a verifier) and MUST NOT render a verifier section for it.

### Tags

| Tag   | Required    | Description                                                                 |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `alt` | Recommended | NIP-31 human-readable fallback describing the event's purpose.              |
| `t`   | Optional    | Agora content marker (`t:agora`). Added at publish time via `withAgoraTag`. |

The statement carries no queryable fields beyond the author and kind — it is identified entirely by `(14672, pubkey)`.

### Querying

**Fetch a user's verifier statement:**

```json
{ "kinds": [14672], "authors": ["<pubkey>"], "limit": 1 }
```

Clients MUST filter by `authors` — a verifier statement only describes the diligence of the pubkey that signed it, so an unfiltered query would be meaningless (and would let anyone's statement be attributed to anyone).

### Client Behavior

- **Becoming a verifier:** a user publishes a kind 14672 event with their statement in `content`. No approval, allowlist, or moderation gate applies.
- **Withdrawing:** a user republishes the event with empty `content`, or publishes a NIP-09 kind 5 deletion referencing the event. Either way clients stop rendering the verifier section.
- **Rendering:** clients SHOULD surface the statement prominently on the author's profile (e.g. a dedicated "Verifier" section in the profile overview), rendering the Markdown content sanitized.
- **Editing:** because the kind is replaceable, the latest event per `(14672, pubkey)` wins. Clients performing an edit SHOULD pass the previous event as `prev` so `published_at` is preserved (NIP-23 convention).

## Kind 16769: Profile Tabs

### Summary

Replaceable event kind for publishing a user's custom profile page tabs. Exactly one event per user (no `d` tag). Each tab defines a Nostr filter (NIP-01) that clients execute to populate the tab's content.

Visitors who load a profile fetch this event to display the custom tabs alongside the standard Posts / Media / Likes / Wall tabs.

### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 16769,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["var", "$follows", "p", "a:3:$me:"],
    ["tab", "Bitcoin Posts", "{\"kinds\":[1],\"authors\":[\"$me\"],\"search\":\"bitcoin\"}"],
    ["tab", "Feed", "{\"kinds\":[1,6],\"authors\":[\"$follows\"],\"limit\":40}"],
    ["alt", "Custom profile tabs"]
  ]
}
```

### Content

The `content` field is unused and MUST be an empty string (`""`).

### Tags

| Tag   | Format                                         | Description                                                    |
|-------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tab` | `["tab", "<label>", "<filterJSON>"]`           | One tag per custom tab. Order defines display order.           |
| `var` | `["var", "<$name>", "<tag>", "<pointer>"]`     | Variable definition. See [Variable Tags](#variable-tags).      |
| `alt` | `["alt", "Custom profile tabs"]`               | NIP-31 human-readable fallback. Required.                      |

### Tab Filter JSON

The third element of each `tab` tag is a JSON-encoded **NIP-01 filter object**, optionally extended with the NIP-50 `search` field. Variable placeholders (strings starting with `$`) may appear wherever a string value is expected.

```json
{
  "kinds": [1],
  "authors": ["$me"],
  "search": "bitcoin",
  "limit": 20
}
```

Supported filter fields: `ids`, `authors`, `kinds`, `#<tag>` (e.g. `#t`, `#e`, `#p`), `since`, `until`, `limit`, `search`.

### Variable Tags

Variable tags define named placeholders that are resolved before the filter is executed. Each `var` tag extracts tag values from a referenced Nostr event.

Format: `["var", "$name", "<tag-to-extract>", "<event-pointer>"]`

| Index | Description                                                                                      |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | Tag name: `"var"`                                                                                |
| 1     | Variable name, starting with `$` (e.g. `"$follows"`)                                            |
| 2     | Tag name to extract values from in the referenced event (e.g. `"p"`)                             |
| 3     | Event pointer: `e:<event-id>` for a specific event, or `a:<kind>:<pubkey>:<d-tag>` for an addressable/replaceable event coordinate. Variables like `$me` may appear in the pubkey position. |

Example — extract follow list pubkeys:
```json
["var", "$follows", "p", "a:3:$me:"]
```

This means: fetch the kind 3 event authored by `$me`, extract all `p` tag values, and bind them to `$follows`.

### Reserved Variable: `$me`

The `$me` variable is the only runtime-provided variable. It resolves to the **profile owner's pubkey** (the author of the kind 16769 event). It does not require a `var` tag definition.

### Variable Resolution

When a variable appears in a filter field that expects an array (e.g. `authors`, `ids`, `#p`), the variable is **expanded in-place** (spliced into the array). Literal values may be mixed with variables.

```json
["tab", "Mixed", "{\"authors\":[\"$follows\",\"abc123...\"],\"kinds\":[1]}"]
```

After resolution (assuming `$follows` = `["pk1", "pk2"]`):
```json
{"authors": ["pk1", "pk2", "abc123..."], "kinds": [1]}
```

### Behavior

- To **add or update** tabs: publish a new kind 16769 event with all current `tab` and `var` tags.
- To **clear** all tabs: publish a kind 16769 event with no `tab` tags (only `alt`).
- Clients MUST filter by `authors: [pubkey]` when querying to prevent spoofing.
- `var` tags are shared across all `tab` tags in the same event.

## Kind 36639: Pledge

### Summary

Addressable event kind for publishing **pledges**. A pledge is donor intent to fund a concrete action, evidence request, or outcome — take a photo, make art, gather information, clean a beach, or take direct action — with an optional country scope, optional community scope, and a sats-denominated pledge amount paid out via zaps or donation receipts to the best **submissions**.

Submissions are **NIP-22 comments** (kind 1111) authored under the pledge's coordinate, ranked by zap totals. There is no separate submission kind; an earlier draft (kind 36640) was deprecated in favor of NIP-22 reuse.

### Trust model

Pledges are user-generated. Anyone can publish a kind 36639 event, and Agora displays valid pledges without platform-admin or country-organizer author filtering.

Community-scoped pledges inherit the community's moderation context. Clients rendering a specific community SHOULD query by the community `A` tag and apply that community's moderation and membership filters.

### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 36639,
  "content": "<long-form description, freeform markdown-ish text>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "plant-a-tree-1729000000000"],
    ["title", "Plant a tree in your neighborhood"],
    ["bounty", "10000"],
    ["i", "iso3166:US"],
    ["A", "34550:<community-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"],
    ["K", "34550"],
    ["P", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["t", "agora-action"],
    ["t", "tree-planting"],
    ["t", "local-action"],
    ["image", "https://example.com/cover.jpg"],
    ["deadline", "1729604800"],
    ["alt", "Agora pledge: Plant a tree in your neighborhood"]
  ]
}
```

### Tags

| Tag              | Required | Description                                                                                              |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `d`              | Yes      | Unique identifier (typically slug + timestamp). Forms the addressable coordinate `36639:<pubkey>:<d>`.   |
| `title`          | Yes      | Short title shown on cards.                                                                              |
| `bounty`         | Yes      | Pledge amount in **sats**, as an unsigned integer string. Paid out via zaps or donation receipts to chosen submission(s). |
| `i`              | No       | NIP-73 country identifier: `iso3166:XX` (preferred). Legacy `geo:XX` (length 6, country code only) is accepted as a read alias. Optionally combined with a `location` tag fallback. |
| `A`              | No       | Community root coordinate for community-scoped pledges, e.g. `34550:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`.                 |
| `K`              | No       | Root kind hint for community-scoped pledges. Use `34550` when `A` points to a NIP-72 community.         |
| `P`              | No       | Root author hint for community-scoped pledges. Use the community definition author pubkey.              |
| `t`              | Yes      | Discovery and category tags. Canonical write value includes `agora-action`; additional `t` tags are optional hashtags/categories. Read aliases: `pathos-challenge`, `agora-challenge`. |
| `image`          | No       | Cover image URL.                                                                                         |
| `start`          | No       | Legacy. Unix timestamp when the pledge becomes active. Defaults to `created_at`. New pledges omit it; the `created_at` is the start.    |
| `deadline`       | No       | Optional Unix timestamp when the pledge expires. Omit for open-ended pledges.                            |
| `alt`            | Yes      | NIP-31 human-readable fallback. Convention: `"Agora pledge: <title>"`.                                   |

### Content

Long-form description of the pledge. Plain text or light markdown. Clients render this as the pledge's body on the detail page.

### Categories

Clients SHOULD use optional `t` tags for filtering and discovery instead of the deprecated `challenge-type` tag. Suggested user-entered tags include values like `beach-cleanup`, `protest-documentation`, `internet-blackout`, `legal-defense`, or `mutual-aid`.

### Submissions

Submissions are kind 1111 NIP-22 comments addressed to the pledge's coordinate (`["A", "36639:<pubkey>:<d>"]` and `["P", "<pubkey>"]`). Clients SHOULD:

- Sort top-level submissions by **total funded amount** (sum of kind 9735 zap receipts and kind 8333 donation receipts on each submission), descending.
- Show the pledge amount, total funded, and remaining amount as a trust-based progress indicator. There is no escrow guarantee.
- Hide submissions with `created_at` after the pledge's `deadline` for "past" leaderboards (or surface them separately as "late submissions"). Open-ended pledges have no deadline cutoff.

### Discovery

Clients querying pledges globally:

```json
{ "kinds": [36639], "#t": ["agora-action", "pathos-challenge", "agora-challenge"], "limit": 50 }
```

Per country:

```json
{
  "kinds": [36639],
  "#t": ["agora-action", "pathos-challenge", "agora-challenge"],
  "#i": ["iso3166:US", "geo:US"],
  "limit": 50
}
```

Per community:

```json
{
  "kinds": [36639],
  "#A": ["34550:<community-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"],
  "limit": 50
}
```

Country and community scopes are independent. A future action MAY include both `i` and `A`/`K`/`P` tags when both scopes are useful.

---

## Kind 30385: Community Stats Snapshot

### Summary

Addressable event kind for **pre-computed community statistics** (per-country and global). A trusted off-app indexer (the "stats bot") publishes one event per scope:

- **Per-country**: `d` tag is `iso3166:XX` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code).
- **Global**: `d` tag is `iso3166:ZZ` — `ZZ` is the ISO 3166-1 user-assigned code Agora uses for the cross-country aggregate.

Each event contains aggregate counts (comments, authors, zaps, submissions) and ranked leaderboards (top posters, trending hashtags, top zapped authors, top donors, top actions) across multiple time windows (`7d`, `30d`, `90d`, all-time). Storing pre-computed leaderboards in a single event lets clients render community pages without scanning thousands of underlying events.

### Trust model

Anyone can publish kind 30385, but clients MUST only consume events from trusted authors:

- **Per-country events**: trusted authors are platform admins (`src/lib/admins.ts`) **plus** appointed organizers for that specific country (kind 30078 `agora-organizers`).
- **Global event** (`iso3166:ZZ`): trusted authors are platform admins only.

When multiple trusted events exist for the same scope, clients pick the most recent by `created_at`.

### Event Structure

```json
{
  "kind": 30385,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "iso3166:US"],

    ["comment_cnt", "12345"],
    ["comment_cnt_7d", "789"],

    ["top_action", "36639:<pubkey>:<d-tag>", "Plant a tree", "<submissions>", "<bounty>", "<zapAmountSats>"]
  ]
}
```

### Tag families

All numeric values are unsigned integers serialised as base-10 strings.

#### Aggregate counts (one tag per metric per timeframe)

| Tag base name      | Meaning                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `comment_cnt`      | Number of NIP-22 comments in scope                     |
| `author_cnt`       | Distinct author pubkeys in scope                       |
| `zap_amount`       | Total zap amount in **sats**                           |
| `zap_cnt`          | Number of NIP-57 zap receipts                          |
| `submission_cnt`   | Submissions to activist actions (kind 36639)           |

Each is published as four tags: bare (`<base>`, all-time), `<base>_7d`, `<base>_30d`, `<base>_90d`.

#### Leaderboards (repeated; one tag per row, ordered by rank)

All-time variants use the bare tag name; windowed variants use the `_7d`, `_30d`, `_90d` suffixes.

| Tag base name        | Positional fields                                                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `top_poster`         | `[name, pubkeyHex, count]`                                                                    |
| `trending_hashtag`   | `[name, hashtag, count]`                                                                      |
| `top_zapped`         | `[name, pubkeyHex, totalSats, postCount, avgSats, zapCount]` (`zapCount` optional, legacy)    |
| `top_donor`          | `[name, pubkeyHex, totalSats, zapCount]`                                                      |
| `top_action`         | `[name, "36639:<pubkey>:<d>", title, submissions, bounty, zapAmountSats]`                     |

Clients SHOULD parse defensively — accept missing trailing fields as `0` or omitted to maintain backwards compatibility as the schema evolves.

### Content

Empty string. All data lives in tags so relays can index/filter and clients don't need to parse JSON.

### Discovery

Per-country snapshot:

```json
{
  "kinds": [30385],
  "authors": [<admin and organizer pubkeys>],
  "#d": ["iso3166:US"],
  "limit": 10
}
```

Global snapshot:

```json
{
  "kinds": [30385],
  "authors": [<admin pubkeys>],
  "#d": ["iso3166:ZZ"],
  "limit": 10
}
```

After fetching, take the event with the highest `created_at` and parse it. Cache for ~1–2 minutes; the producer typically refreshes on a similar cadence.

---

## Flat Communities

Flat communities on Nostr, composed from existing event kinds. Communities have one membership badge, explicit moderators, and no recursive badge-chain authority.

This specification is intended to be a foundation for community-scoped features. A community is a kind `34550` root that other events can tag with uppercase `A`. Posts, events, polls, listings, and future content kinds can all participate in the same community model when they tag the community root and pass the membership and moderation rules below.

The initial implementation focuses on three foundation capabilities:

1. Viewing communities a user owns or belongs to.
2. Posting community-scoped discussion content.
3. Moderating community-scoped content and members within communities the viewer has authority over.

**No new event kinds are introduced.** The system composes:

- **Kind 34550** ([NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md)) -- Community Definition
- **Kind 30009** ([NIP-58](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md)) -- Badge Definition
- **Kind 8** ([NIP-58](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md)) -- Badge Award
- **Kind 1111** ([NIP-22](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/22.md)) -- Community Posts
- **Kind 1984** ([NIP-56](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/56.md)) -- Moderation
### Overview

A flat community consists of:

1. **One badge definition** (kind `30009`) that represents community membership.
2. A **community definition** (kind `34550`) referencing that member badge with the role marker `"member"`.
3. **Badge awards** (kind `8`) authored by the founder or current moderators, granting membership directly.
4. **Community-scoped content** (initially kind `1111`) tagged to the community root.
5. **Reports and bans** (kind `1984`) scoped to the community for content warnings, content removal, and member/non-member bans.

Parent, child, sister, and rank relationships are intentionally out of scope for the core permission model. Apps may build discovery or directory surfaces separately.

### Membership Derivation

Membership is sourced from the community definition and from validated kind `8` membership awards. This produces three populations:

- **Founder** -- the `pubkey` field on the kind `34550` event. One per community, immutable. Controls the community definition since only they can republish the addressable event.
- **Moderators** -- the `p` tags on the kind `34550` event with role `"moderator"` (matching [NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md)). Mutable by republishing the community definition.
- **Members** -- pubkeys named in `p` tags on kind `8` badge awards that reference the community's member badge and are authored by the founder or a current moderator.

The founder and moderators have no membership badge requirement. Their leadership status comes from the community definition itself. Members cannot grant membership to other members.

### Community Definition

A kind `34550` event defines the community, extending [NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md) with one badge `a` tag that identifies the member badge.

#### Tags

| Tag | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `d` | Yes | Unique community identifier (UUID recommended). |
| `name` | Yes | Human-readable name. |
| `description` | No | Community description. |
| `image` | No | Image URL. |
| `a` | Yes (1) | Member badge definition reference with role marker `"member"`. |
| `p` | No | Moderator pubkeys. The 4th element SHOULD be `"moderator"`. |
| `i` | No | Agora extension: NIP-73 country identifier (`iso3166:XX`) for country-scoped group discovery. This is not part of NIP-72. |
| `k` | Recommended if `i` is present | Agora extension: external content kind hint. Use `iso3166` for country identifiers. |
| `t` | No | Agora extension: user-entered discovery/category tags. Agora also adds `t:agora` as the app marker. |
| `relay` | No | Recommended relay URL for community content (per [NIP-72](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md)). |
| `alt` | No | [NIP-31](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/31.md) description. |

#### Badge `a` Tag Format

```
["a", "30009:<pubkey>:<badge-d-tag>", "<relay-hint>", "member"]
```

The fourth element is a strict protocol marker, not a display label. Communities can still use the badge definition's `name`, `description`, and `image` tags for expressive member labels.

#### Example

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 34550,
  "pubkey": "<founder-pubkey>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"],
    ["name", "The Arbiter's Guard"],
    ["description", "Elite Halo 2 clan"],
    ["image", "https://example.com/clan-banner.jpg"],
    ["a", "30009:<founder-pubkey>:a1b2c3d4-...-member", "", "member"],
    ["p", "<co-moderator-pubkey>", "", "moderator"],
    ["i", "iso3166:US"],
    ["k", "iso3166"],
    ["t", "local-news"],
    ["t", "mutual-aid"],
    ["relay", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["alt", "Community: The Arbiter's Guard"]
  ]
}
```

### Badge Definitions

The member badge is a standard [NIP-58](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md) kind `30009` badge definition published by the founder. The badge definition SHOULD be published **before** the community definition that references it.

The `d` tag SHOULD use the format `<community-d-tag>-member` for global uniqueness.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 30009,
  "pubkey": "<founder-pubkey>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "a1b2c3d4-...-member"],
    ["name", "Member"],
    ["description", "Member of The Arbiter's Guard"],
    ["image", "https://example.com/member-badge.png"],
    ["alt", "Badge definition: Member of The Arbiter's Guard"]
  ]
}
```

### Badge Awards

Membership is established through kind `8` badge awards ([NIP-58](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md)). Each valid award grants membership directly.

A badge award is **valid** if and only if:

1. The `a` tag references the member badge listed in the community definition.
2. The award author is the founder or a moderator listed in the community definition currently being evaluated.
3. The award contains at least one `p` tag naming an awarded pubkey.

```jsonc
// Moderator awarding community membership
{
  "kind": 8,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30009:<founder-pubkey>:a1b2c3d4-...-member"],
    ["p", "<recipient-pubkey>"],
    ["alt", "Badge award: Staff in The Arbiter's Guard"]
  ]
}
```

### Membership Validation

Membership is resolved with indexed relay filters. There is no recursive authority graph.

#### Algorithm

1. Fetch the community definition using kind `34550`, the founder pubkey, and the community `d` tag.
2. Extract the founder pubkey, moderator pubkeys, and member badge coordinate.
3. Query awards: `{ kinds: [8], authors: [<founder>, ...<moderators>], #a: [<member-badge-coordinate>] }`.
4. Flatten `p` tags from matching awards.
5. The member set is the union of the founder, current moderators, and awarded pubkeys.
6. Resolve moderation and apply moderation overlays.

The `authors` filter is the primary membership-award trust boundary. Awards from non-founder, non-moderator pubkeys are not valid community membership awards.

### Community-Scoped Content

Community-scoped content is any event that tags the community definition with uppercase `A`. The foundation implementation starts with kind `1111` ([NIP-22](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/22.md)) posts, but the same moderation overlay applies to future community content kinds such as calendar events, polls, listings, or other domain-specific events.

Clients MAY offer a members-only view that filters community posts down to the resolved member set as an `authors` filter. Whether this is on by default, opt-in, or omitted entirely is a client UX choice -- the protocol makes no recommendation.

#### Community Post

Community discussion uses kind `1111` scoped to the community definition as the root event.

#### Top-Level Post

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "content": "Hello clan!",
  "tags": [
    ["A", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["K", "34550"],
    ["P", "<founder-pubkey>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["a", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["k", "34550"],
    ["p", "<founder-pubkey>", "<relay-hint>"]
  ]
}
```

#### Reply

Replies keep the community as root scope and point to the parent comment:

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "content": "Great point!",
  "tags": [
    ["A", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["K", "34550"],
    ["P", "<founder-pubkey>", "<relay-hint>"],
    ["e", "<parent-comment-id>", "<relay-hint>", "<parent-author-pubkey>"],
    ["k", "1111"],
    ["p", "<parent-author-pubkey>", "<relay-hint>"]
  ]
}
```

#### Querying

Clients MAY use the resolved member set as an `authors` filter for members-only views.

```jsonc
{
  "kinds": [1111],
  "#A": ["34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"],
  "authors": ["<founder>", "<moderator>", "<member>"]
}
```

The moderation overlay is content-kind agnostic: a valid content ban or warning applies to the targeted event regardless of whether that event is a post, calendar event, poll, listing, or future supported kind.

### Moderation

Moderation uses kind `1984` ([NIP-56](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/56.md)) scoped to the community via the uppercase `A` tag. Moderation is derived state: clients first resolve trusted moderation actions from kind `1984`, then apply those actions to concrete community-scoped events.

There are two moderation event classes:

1. **Bans** -- authoritative actions that remove content or ban users. Identified by the presence of [NIP-32](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/32.md) label tags `["L", "moderation"]` and `["l", "ban", "moderation"]`.
2. **Reports** -- soft flags from any valid community member using standard [NIP-56](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/56.md) report types (`nudity`, `spam`, `profanity`, `illegal`, `malware`, `impersonation`, `other`). No `L`/`l` tags. Clients display a content warning that users must click through to reveal.

Kind `1984` events from **non-members** are ignored entirely within community context. Kind `1984` events from members who are themselves banned are also ignored after ban resolution; banned members cannot retain moderation or reporting authority.

#### Bans (Authoritative Moderation)

A ban is **authoritative** if and only if:

1. The event contains `["l", "ban", "moderation"]` and `["L", "moderation"]` tags.
2. The publisher is a validated community member.
3. The publisher is not themselves banned after ban resolution.
4. The publisher's authority covers the target:
   - founder/moderators may ban member and non-member authors/content;
   - members may ban only non-member authors/content.

Bans that fail any of these conditions MUST be ignored.

##### Content Ban

Ban a specific post by publishing kind `1984` with `e`, `p`, and `A` tags plus the `ban` label. The `e` and `p` tags use `"other"` as the NIP-56 report type since the action is administrative rather than categorical.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
  "content": "Reason for removal",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<offending-event-id>", "other"],
    ["p", "<offending-author-pubkey>", "other"],
    ["A", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"],
    ["L", "moderation"],
    ["l", "ban", "moderation"]
  ]
}
```

Clients MUST omit the banned event from canonical community feeds entirely. The event is not displayed, blurred, or indicated in any way -- it is treated as if it does not exist.

The `e` and `p` tags are untrusted until matched against the actual target event. A content ban MUST only apply when the targeted event's `id` matches the ban's `e` tag and the targeted event's `pubkey` matches the ban's `p` tag. This prevents a malicious or mistaken report from hiding an event by pairing its event ID with a different target pubkey.

##### Member Ban

Ban an author by publishing kind `1984` with `p` and `A` tags only (no `e` tag) plus the `ban` label. Founder/moderator-authored bans may target members or non-members. Member-authored bans may target non-members only.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
  "content": "Reason for ban",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<banned-pubkey>", "other"],
    ["A", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"],
    ["L", "moderation"],
    ["l", "ban", "moderation"]
  ]
}
```

Clients distinguish content bans (`e` + `p` + `A` + `ban` label) from member bans (`p` + `A` + `ban` label, no `e` tag).

#### Reports (Content Warnings)

Any **valid, non-banned community member** may report content by publishing kind `1984` with a standard NIP-56 report type on the `e` and `p` tags. Reports do NOT use `L`/`l` label tags.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<member-pubkey>",
  "content": "Additional context",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<event-id>", "nudity"],
    ["p", "<author-pubkey>", "nudity"],
    ["A", "34550:<founder-pubkey>:<community-d-tag>"]
  ]
}
```

Clients SHOULD display reported content behind a content warning overlay that requires user interaction to reveal. The report type (e.g. `nudity`, `spam`) MAY be shown in the warning. Multiple reports on the same event reinforce the warning but do not automatically escalate to a ban.

Reports from non-members and banned members are ignored.

As with content bans, report warnings MUST only attach to content when the target event's `id` matches the report's `e` tag and the target event's `pubkey` matches the report's `p` tag.

#### Classification Summary

| `l` tag present? | `e` tag present? | Authority check | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `["l", "ban", "moderation"]` | Yes | Founder/moderator, or member targeting non-member content; `e`/`p` match target event | Content ban (omit event) |
| `["l", "ban", "moderation"]` | No | Founder/moderator, or member targeting non-member author | Author ban |
| No | Yes | Non-banned member; `e`/`p` match target event | Content warning |
| No | No | -- | Invalid (ignored) |
| Any | Any | Non-member | Ignored |
| Any | Any | Banned member | Ignored |

### Community Updates

Both kind `34550` and kind `30009` are addressable events. To change the member badge or update moderators, republish the community definition. Only the founder (event publisher) can republish the community definition. If a moderator is removed, their authored membership awards no longer count because they are excluded from the authorized awarder query.

### Discovery

**Communities founded by a user:**

```jsonc
{ "kinds": [34550], "authors": ["<user-pubkey>"] }
```

**Communities a user belongs to:**

1. `{ "kinds": [8], "#p": ["<user-pubkey>"] }`
2. Extract badge `a` tags from results.
3. `{ "kinds": [34550], "#a": ["30009:...", "..."] }`
4. Keep only communities whose `member` badge reference matches the award badge coordinate.

**Communities a user has bookmarked:**

Agora uses [NIP-51](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md) kind `10004` ("Communities") to let users save communities they want quick access to without requiring membership. Bookmarked communities are surfaced in the "My Communities" view alongside founded and member-of communities.

1. `{ "kinds": [10004], "authors": ["<user-pubkey>"], "limit": 1 }`
2. Extract `a` tags whose value begins with `34550:` from the result.
3. For each coordinate `34550:<author-pubkey>:<d-tag>`, query the community definition with both `authors` and `#d` filters to prevent spoofing:

   ```jsonc
   { "kinds": [34550], "authors": ["<author-pubkey>"], "#d": ["<d-tag>"], "limit": 1 }
   ```

Clients toggling a bookmark MUST perform a read-modify-write cycle on the replaceable kind `10004` event: fetch the freshest version from relays, add or remove the matching `["a", "34550:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"]` tag, and republish the full tag list. Appending new entries to the end preserves chronological bookmark order per NIP-51.

When the same community appears in multiple discovery sources, clients SHOULD display a single card but MAY indicate all applicable relationships (e.g. a member who has also bookmarked a community).

### Security Considerations

- **Author filtering**: Clients MUST filter community definitions by `authors` to prevent impersonation.
- **Award author filtering is required**: Query member badge awards with `authors: [founder, ...moderators]`.
- **Badge d-tag uniqueness**: Use `<community-d-tag>-member` to prevent cross-community collisions.
- **Badge acceptance is cosmetic**: NIP-58 kind `10008`/`30008` events have no effect on community membership.

## Community Fundraising Goals (NIP-75)

### Summary

Communities can host fundraising campaigns using [NIP-75 Zap Goals](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/75.md) (kind `9041`). A zap goal linked to a community allows members and supporters to contribute sats toward a shared target.

### Linking Goals to Communities

A zap goal is linked to a community by including an `a` tag pointing to the community's kind `34550` definition:

```json
{
  "kind": 9041,
  "content": "Community meetup travel fund",
  "tags": [
    ["amount", "500000000"],
    ["relays", "wss://relay.ditto.pub", "wss://relay.primal.net"],
    ["a", "34550:<community-author-pubkey>:<community-d-identifier>"],
    ["alt", "Zap goal: Community meetup travel fund"],
    ["summary", "Help fund travel for our annual meetup"],
    ["image", "https://example.com/meetup.jpg"],
    ["closed_at", "1735689600"]
  ]
}
```

### Required Tags (per NIP-75)

- `amount` -- Target amount in millisatoshis
- `relays` -- Relay URLs where zaps should be sent and tallied from

### Optional Tags (per NIP-75)

- `closed_at` -- Unix timestamp deadline; zap receipts after this time are excluded from the tally
- `image` -- Image URL for the goal
- `summary` -- Brief description

### Additional Tags (Agora-specific)

- `a` -- Community link (`34550:<pubkey>:<d-tag>`) scoping the goal to a community
- `alt` -- NIP-31 human-readable description

### Querying

Community goals are queried by filtering on the `a` tag:

```
{ "kinds": [9041], "#a": ["34550:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"], "limit": 50 }
```

### Progress Tallying

Goal progress is calculated from kind `9735` zap receipts targeting the goal event:

```
{ "kinds": [9735], "#e": ["<goal-event-id>"], "limit": 500 }
```

Receipts with `created_at` after the `closed_at` deadline (if set) are excluded from the tally.

### Access Control

Anyone may create a zap goal linked to a community. The existing community members-only feed filter controls whether non-member goals are displayed. Anyone may zap a goal.

## Kind 0 Extension: Avatar Shape

### Summary

An optional `shape` property on kind 0 (profile metadata) that controls how the user's avatar is masked/clipped when displayed. The value is an emoji character whose silhouette is used as a mask over the avatar image. When absent, the avatar renders as the standard circle.

### Metadata Field

The `shape` field is added to the JSON content of a kind 0 event alongside standard fields like `name`, `picture`, etc. Its value is a single emoji character (including multi-codepoint emoji such as flags, ZWJ sequences, and skin-tone variants).

```json
{
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\":\"Luna\",\"picture\":\"https://example.com/luna.jpg\",\"shape\":\"🌙\"}"
}
```

### Client Behavior

- When `shape` is absent, clients SHOULD render the avatar as a circle (the current universal default).
- When `shape` is a valid emoji, clients SHOULD use the emoji's silhouette as an alpha mask over the avatar image. The specific rendering technique is platform-dependent (see below).
- When `shape` is set to an unrecognized or invalid value, clients MUST fall back to a circle. This ensures forward compatibility.
- The `shape` field is purely cosmetic and has no protocol-level significance.
- Clients MAY choose not to support this extension, in which case avatars render as circles as usual.

## Community NIP Specifications

The following specifications are maintained by their respective authors. Ditto implements these kinds but does not own the specs. See each link for the full event structure, tags, and client behavior.

### Color Moments (Kind 3367)

**Author:** Chad Curtis
**Spec:** https://gitlab.com/chad.curtis/espy/-/blob/main/NIP.md
**App:** https://espy.you

Color palette posts capturing 3-6 colors from a beautiful moment, optionally accompanied by an emoji and layout preference. Supports horizontal, vertical, grid, star, checkerboard, and diagonal stripe layouts. A form of pre-verbal visual communication through color and emotion.

### Birdstar (Kinds 2473, 12473, 30621)

**Author:** Alex Gleason
**Spec:** https://gitlab.com/alexgleason/birdstar/-/blob/main/NIP.md
**App:** https://birdstar.app

Birdstar merges Birdsong Spotter (a bird-by-ear checklist) and Starpoint (an interactive sky map with community constellations) into a single client.

- **Kind 2473 — Bird Detection.** A regular event representing a single identified bird observation. The species is identified by a NIP-73 `i`/`k` pair pointing at the species' Wikidata entity URI (e.g. `https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q26825` for the American Robin). The `content` field holds an optional freeform human note about the detection. Required tags: NIP-31 `alt`, NIP-73 `i` (Wikidata URL) + `k` (`web`). Ditto renders detections as a species card with the Wikipedia thumbnail, common/scientific name, and article summary.
- **Kind 12473 — Birdex.** A replaceable event (one per author) indexing every distinct species the author has ever confirmed via kind 2473. Each species is a positional `i`/`n` pair — the Wikidata entity URI followed immediately by the scientific binomial name — emitted in chronological order of first detection. Ditto renders a Birdex as a tiled grid of species, each tile showing the Wikipedia thumbnail with the common name overlaid. In feeds, only the most recent few tiles are shown with a "+N" capstone mirroring how kind 3 follow lists preview members; the post-detail page shows every species.
- **Kind 30621 — Custom Constellation.** An addressable event (`d` tag) representing a single user-drawn star figure. Each `edge` tag (`["edge", from, to]`) references two Hipparcos catalog numbers as decimal strings — e.g. `["edge", "32349", "37279"]` for Sirius → Procyon. Required tags: `d`, `title`, `alt`, and at least one valid `edge`. The `content` field is a freeform description. Ditto renders constellations as a stylized SVG star-map (gnomonically projected onto a tangent plane at the figure's centroid, with stars sized by magnitude) using a bundled Hipparcos catalog that is code-split so the data only loads when a constellation is actually viewed.

### Geocaching (Kinds 37516, 7516)

**Author:** Chad Curtis
**Spec:** https://gitlab.com/chad.curtis/treasures/-/blob/main/NIP-GC.md
**App:** https://treasures.to

NIP-GC defines geocaching on Nostr. Kind 37516 (addressable) is a geocache listing with location (geohash), difficulty/terrain scores, size, and type. Kind 7516 is a found log recording a successful visit. The spec also covers comment logs (kind 1111 via NIP-22), verified finds with cryptographic proof (kind 7517), and cache retirement.

### Personal Letters (Kind 8211)

**Author:** Chad Curtis
**Spec:** https://gitlab.com/chad.curtis/lief/-/blob/main/NIP.md
**App:** https://lief.to

NIP-44 encrypted personal letters with visual stationery, hand-drawn stickers, decorative frames, and custom fonts. Letters render as 5:4 landscape postcards. The privacy model is intentionally postcard-like: sender/recipient metadata is visible, content is encrypted.

### Weather Station (Kinds 4223, 16158)

**Author:** Sam Thomson
**Spec:** https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/pull/2163
**App:** https://weather.shakespeare.wtf
**Firmware:** https://github.com/samthomson/weather-station

Kind 16158 (replaceable) describes a weather station's configuration: name, geohash location, elevation, power source, connectivity, and sensor inventory. Kind 4223 (regular) carries individual sensor readings as 3-parameter tags `[sensor_type, value, model]`, enabling historical queries and cross-station comparison. Each station has its own keypair.

## Music Tracks & Playlists

### Kind 36787: Music Track

An addressable event containing metadata about an audio file. Full spec maintained externally.

**Required tags:** `d`, `title`, `artist`, `url`, `t` (with value `"music"`)

**Optional tags:** `image`, `video`, `album`, `track_number`, `released`, `duration`, `format`, `bitrate`, `sample_rate`, `language`, `explicit`, `zap`, `alt`

### Kind 34139: Music Playlist

An addressable event containing an ordered list of music track references.

**Required tags:** `d`, `title`, `alt`

**Optional tags:** `description`, `image`, `a` (track references), `t`, `public`, `private`, `collaborative`

Track references use `a` tags in the format `["a", "36787:<pubkey>:<d-tag>"]`.

### Albums (Convention)

Albums are represented as kind 34139 playlist events with a `["t", "album"]` tag. This reuses the existing playlist infrastructure while allowing clients to distinguish albums from user-curated playlists.

**Additional optional tags for albums:**
- `released` — ISO 8601 release date (e.g. `"2024-06-15"`)
- `label` — Record label name

**Example album event:**

```json
{
  "kind": 34139,
  "content": "Debut studio album featuring 12 tracks of ambient electronic music.",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "endless-summer-2024"],
    ["title", "Endless Summer"],
    ["image", "https://cdn.blossom.example/img/album-art.jpg"],
    ["t", "album"],
    ["t", "electronic"],
    ["t", "ambient"],
    ["released", "2024-06-15"],
    ["label", "Sunset Records"],
    ["a", "36787:abc123...:track-1"],
    ["a", "36787:abc123...:track-2"],
    ["a", "36787:abc123...:track-3"],
    ["alt", "Album: Endless Summer by The Midnight Collective"]
  ]
}
```

**Client behavior:**
- Clients detect albums by checking for a `t` tag with value `"album"` (case-insensitive)
- Albums display release date and label information when available
- Track ordering follows the order of `a` tags in the event
- The same detail view, playback, and commenting features apply to both albums and playlists

## Agora HD Wallet Derivation

### Summary

Agora's Bitcoin wallet is hierarchical-deterministic and derived from the user's Nostr secret key (`nsec`). The user backs up either the nsec or the 24-word BIP-39 mnemonic — the mnemonic is a deterministic, one-way function of the nsec, so anyone with the nsec can regenerate the mnemonic at will.

This specification covers two derivation generations:

- **v2 (current)** — nsec → HKDF → BIP-39 24-word mnemonic → PBKDF2 → BIP-32 master seed. The resulting mnemonic imports into any BIP-39-compatible wallet (Sparrow, Electrum, Trezor, Ledger, BlueWallet, Phoenix, …) at the standard BIP-86 / BIP-352 paths.
- **v1 (legacy, migration-only)** — nsec used directly as the BIP-32 master seed (`HDKey.fromMasterSeed(nsec_bytes)`). v1 and v2 produce different addresses for the same nsec.

### v2 Derivation

The v2 pipeline turns a 32-byte nsec into a 64-byte BIP-32 master seed in three steps:

```
entropy  = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = nsec_bytes,
                       salt = "" (default per RFC 5869),
                       info = "agora/v1",
                       length = 32 bytes)
mnemonic = BIP-39 encoding of (entropy || SHA256(entropy)[0])      // 24 words
seed     = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512(password = mnemonic,
                              salt = "mnemonic",
                              iterations = 2048,
                              dkLen = 64)
master   = HDKey.fromMasterSeed(seed)                              // BIP-32 root
```

The `"agora/v1"` HKDF info string is a versioning hook: changing it would derive a completely independent wallet from the same nsec. The `"mnemonic"` PBKDF2 salt is the literal BIP-39 default (no user passphrase).

#### Properties

- **Deterministic** — the same nsec always produces the same mnemonic, seed, and BIP-32 master.
- **One-way** — the mnemonic is a hash of the nsec; an attacker who learns the mnemonic learns only the wallet, not the Nostr identity.
- **Interoperable** — the resulting 24-word phrase is a standard BIP-39 mnemonic. Any BIP-39-compatible wallet can import it at the BIP-86 / BIP-352 paths and recover the same on-chain addresses.

### Address Derivation

Once the BIP-32 master is in hand, addresses derive at the standard paths:

#### BIP-86 (Taproot single-key, key-path-only)

```
m/86'/0'/0'/<chain>/<index>
```

- `chain ∈ {0, 1}` — `0` = receive, `1` = change.
- `index` — advanced per receive (no address reuse).

Output script is P2TR with the derived x-only pubkey as `internalPubkey` (no tapscript tree).

#### BIP-352 (Silent Payments)

```
m/352'/0'/0'/0'/0    // spend keypair
m/352'/0'/0'/1'/0    // scan keypair
```

The silent-payment address (`sp1q…`) is the bech32m encoding of `(scan_pubkey || spend_pubkey)` with version `0` and HRP `sp`. The address is **static** — a user publishes one `sp1q…` and reuses it; each sender derives a fresh, unlinkable Taproot output per payment.

### v1 → v2 Migration

The v1 derivation (`HDKey.fromMasterSeed(nsec_bytes)`) produces a different BIP-32 master than v2 for the same nsec, so a user upgrading from v1 to v2 has funds at addresses that the v2 wallet never scans. Agora ships a one-shot migration page (`/wallet/migrate-v1`) that:

1. Detects v1 funds by scanning the v1 xpub against the configured Blockbook indexer and reading the v1 silent-payment UTXO doc from the user's relays (NIP-78 d-tag `${appId}/hdwallet/sp-utxos`).
2. If any v1 funds exist, builds a single sweep PSBT consuming every v1 BIP-86 UTXO + every v1 SP UTXO, with one output (`total − fee`) at the v2 wallet's first BIP-86 receive address.
3. Signs every input using v1-derived keys (`HDKey.fromMasterSeed(nsec_bytes)`) and broadcasts via Blockbook.

The v1 derivation code is retained indefinitely so users can migrate at any time. New scans, sends, and receives always run against v2.

### NIP-78 Storage

Agora stores per-wallet auxiliary state as a NIP-78 encrypted addressable event (kind 30078, NIP-44 to the user's own pubkey). The v2 d-tag suffix is `hdwallet/sp-utxos/v2`; the legacy v1 d-tag is `hdwallet/sp-utxos`. The two are independent: v2 never writes to the v1 tag, and the v1 tag is read only by the migration sweep.

### Security Notes

- The nsec is both the Nostr identity secret and the wallet seed source. Anyone with the nsec controls both. The 24-word mnemonic is the wallet half of that secret and is safer to share with Bitcoin-side tools (it can't impersonate the user on Nostr).
- The wallet is gated to nsec logins. Browser-extension (NIP-07) and remote-signer (NIP-46) logins do not expose the raw secret key, so the wallet cannot derive child keys and surfaces an "unsupported" state.
- Spend signing happens locally in the browser using the derived BIP-32 leaves. The nsec never leaves the device.
